                    The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by
                    the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game,
                    meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
                    One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 
                    It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

                The rules
            </h3>
            <div class="text-area">
                <p>
                    The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
                    At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
                        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying 
                    the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, 
                    and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of 
                    the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

                The History
            </h3>
            <div class="text-area">
                <p>
                    The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of Scientific American, in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column, which was based on personal conversations with Conway. Theoretically, the Game of Life has the power of a universal Turing machine: anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within the Game of Life. Gardner wrote, "Because of Life's analogies with the rise, fall, and alterations of a society of living organisms, it belongs to a growing class of what are called 'simulation games' (games that resemble real-life processes)."
                    Since its publication, the Game of Life has attracted much interest because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. It provides an example of emergence and self-organization. A version of Life that incorporates random fluctuations has been used in physics to study phase transitions and nonequilibrium dynamics. The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher Daniel Dennett has used the analogy of the Game of Life "universe" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws which might govern our universe.
                    The popularity of the Game of Life was helped by its coming into being at the same time as increasingly inexpensive computer access. The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated fractals. For many, the Game of Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, the Game of Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Game of Life board.

                        The Block is one of the simplest and most common still life patterns (a still life pattern is stable, which mean that its configuration doesn't evolve through the generations). It was discovered by James Conway himself in 1970 and was mentioned for the first time in the original article that presented the Game of Life to the world. Despite their small and simple structure, block serve useful in the construction of more larger patterns

Toads are useful as building blocks for constructing large oscillators with an even period because of the various ways in which they can be hassled.
